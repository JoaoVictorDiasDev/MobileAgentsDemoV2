# Mobile Agents Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Distributed Systems course, focusing on the implementation of mobile agents using Java.

## Project Description
The implementation of mobile agents allows for the creation of autonomous software entities that can migrate from one environment to another, maintaining their execution state and performing tasks on different network hosts.

## Key Features
- Code mobility between different hosts
- Preservation of execution state during migration
- Inter-agent communication
- Autonomous execution of distributed tasks

## Technologies Used
- Java (main language)
- Mobile agent framework (e.g., JADE, Aglets)
- Serialization for state migration
- Security mechanisms for agent protection
